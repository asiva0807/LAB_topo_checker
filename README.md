# LAB_topo_checker
Seperate modules to revert with list of IGP/Transport/BGP states on the list of nodes used in the lab replication

At times when we need to give a quick glance on the list of nodes that we use in the lab replication, we need to check if we have the ARP, Interface status intact; route summary details in correct load level; IGP / Transport / BGP adjacency up and running for X hrs. Running this script we get a quick glance to see the current state and cross compare with previous iterations collected.
